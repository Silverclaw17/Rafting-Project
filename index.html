    <h3>Duke</h3>
    <p>Hey! My name is Paul Merrick, I generally by Duke. I've lived in the beautiful and temperate state of Oregon all of my life.</p>
    <p>I love cybersecurity, so I enrolled in this class. I'm looking forward to meeting and colaborating with all of you!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm interested in learning more about how websites work and operate, to supplement my education. I've not yet graduated from high school, but I intend to pursue a career in cybersecurity.</p>
